		<p>Welcome! I am a Senior Data Scientist at  <a class="bodyLink", href="https://lacounty.gov/",
				target="_blank"> Department of Public Health, County of Los Angeles</a> As a Data Scientist at DPH, I work to develop machine learning models for public health sector. Before joining  DPH, I worked as a 
			Senior Data Scientist for BlackLine Systems, inc.
My research work focuses on innovating and designing applications using machine learning, specifically deep learning technologies.
I am passionate about creating efficient solutions to solve challenging problems in interdisciplinary research areas.
My research interests also includes computer vision, medical image analysis, mHealth, and software engineering.
	    </p>

			<p> I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science in August 2019,
			from Georgia State University. My advisor was Prof. Yanqing Zhang. My dissertation title is
			<a class="bodyLink", href="https://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cs_diss/152/",
					target="_blank"> "Towards AI-Assisted Disease Diagnosis: Learning Deep Feature Representations for Medical Image Analysis"</a>
			</p> I was also a Brain and Behavior (B&B) Fellow of The Neuroscience Institute at Georgia State University. As a B&B fellow,
			I worked to develop automated Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems able to diagnose neurological disorders. I was a student ambassador for Intel.
			As a selected AI Student Ambassador, I worked on different projects collaboratively with Intel focusing on medical image analysis applying deep
			 learning technologies.

	    <p>I joined GSU at fall 2014. Before that, I was a Senior Software Engineer in Samsung R&D Institute Bangladesh. At Samsung R&D,
		I worked to develop an Automated Test Tool for Android application. Besides I worked in the S-voice and media-player app developer team. Before joining  Samsung R&D Institute, I was a Senior Software Engineer at Together Initiatives Limited.
		I worked in developing several enterprise applications and worked extensively in J2EE environment.
		Besides, I was involved in mobile health research based software development. Along with my team, I worked for developing
		"MHealth: Empowering CHWs to Improve Maternal, Newborn and Child Health"
		for <a class="bodyLink", href="http://www.brac.net/", target="_blank"> BRAC</a>.


	    <p>I obtained my Bachelors and Masters degree in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href "http://www.du.ac.bd/">
			University of Dhaka</a>, Bangladesh.</p>
